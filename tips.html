                  <p>Once you have discovered a large monster and attacked it with your weapon, the hunt is on!<br>
                    <br>
                    Each monster has unique traits and attacks that it will utilize in combat. Watch each monster's behavior carefully, and learn when to keep a safe distance, or when you should try luring it out of dangerous areas to ones more suited to combat.</p>

                        <p>Many of your quest objectives will consist of hunting large monsters. However, before you can hunt any monster you'll have to find it, first.<br>
                            <br>
                            Monsters leave behind tracks or traces as they move about the environment, which you can follow to track a monster's location. Whenever you get close to monster tracks, your scoutflies will glow and lead you to them.<br>
                            <br>
                            You can gather tracks by pressing B next to them. As you gather more tracks, your scoutflies' ability to find the same monster's tracks will improve, and they will eventually be able to lead you right to the monster itself!</p>

                        You can upgrade your equipment by visiting the Smithy in Astera. Regularly upgrading your armor will make it easier for you to take on even the toughest of monsters!</p>
